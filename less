Imagine, if you will, the 4th dimension as a photo camera. A still frame is taken of the 3rd dimension[^still]; these images, overlaid in order, become a body's experience of the 4th dimension. Time, in this system, exists as the frame-rate of the camera; the closer to light speed a body is, the slower its relative time. In our metaphor, this would be represented as the gaps between each frame.
